 Hi Brian and Emiko,
     <p style="padding-left:20pt;">
     How are you all doing? And how is the work at West LA going? And how
     is Emiko's work going? We had beautiful snow here this year. But now we are in
     Indonesia until end of January. Nary has braces now and she was at
     the top of her class and received her ESL Certificate. 
     Here are some pictures of events
     in 2015 and a recording of Nary on the Worship Team. Can you find Nary
     in this abstract picture of the Worship Team? We hope you can
     come visit here again.</p>
 Kurt and Nary

Hi Davida and Ruby and Molly,
<p style="padding-left:20pt;">
We are in Indonesia and we are now at Nary's mother's house near Jakarta. There is no air conditioning, we must keep the windows open at night and there are no screens on the windows. I have many bug bites. In the house are myself, Nary, Rayna, Levi, Nary's mother, Nary's aunt (who is widow and Muslim from small village), Nary's sister and niece (who is four years old), Nary's nephew Ryan (who is same age as Rayna), Nary's brother Dion and a man who is the new housekeeper (he stays at the house four days per week). This time, Nary brought some food items from America that she has come to like and cannot be found in Indonesia - couscous, string cheese, and oatmeal. So she is teaching all these people to appreciate these food items. This is a recording of Nary on the Worship Team. Can you find Nary
in this abstract picture of the Worship Team? We are looking forward to seeing you all in February and caring for Ruby.
</p>
Love, Kurt and Nary

 Hi Akemi,
     <p style="padding-left:20pt;">
     How is your wonderful family doing? We spent a fun Christmas in Indonesia and
     because I had to leave the country to renew my visa, we spent a few days in 
     Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We visited a nice bird sanctuary there. At a traditional
     market there was a sand in a bottle artist. By pouring colored sand into the small
     bottle, he created a landscape, including horses, and including our names.
     I got a job offer yesterday and it is very exciting work on satellite stuff.
     However, it is in Denver so we have to think about it. Thank you for your
     historical pictures. We hope you can visit again.</p>
 Kurt and Nary
